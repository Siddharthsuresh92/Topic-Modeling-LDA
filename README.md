# Topic-Modeling-LDA

This topic modeling exercise using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a basic tutorial on how latent topics from a corpus could be extracted. This is being designed for a tutorial session for 4th year commerce students at University of Virginia. 

As a future MS in Data Science graduate (May 2020 to be precise), I really enjoy sharing knowledge with others. So this entire project came about using that motivation.

The jupyter notebook explains various aspects of:
1. Data pre-processing
2. LDA topic modeling
3. Python libraries that help in these analysis

There are two datasets used in the analysis:
1. Corpus with news article headlines (each about the length of a sentence) and a total of 1.1 million such headlines
2. Corpus with wine reviews (each having a full description of about 3-4 sentences) and a total of 118k such reviews

Hope this helps anyone looking to learn topic modeling using LDA.
